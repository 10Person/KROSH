# KROSH
The KrOS-H Operating System

or 

**Kr(alin's) O(perating) S(ystem) - H(i)**

Chosen solely to refrence one of my favorite cartoon characters from when I was young. (Please don't sue me.)
That's literally the only reason.

# Special thanks to: nanobyte: https://www.youtube.com/@nanobyte-dev for teaching me!

# Current Status:
Just booting to HALT, the equivalent of "Hello, World!" for OS-dev.


# Design: 
Currently intended to be a very basic operating system to learn about the design. For the record, this is my first major project in ASM so expect very poor quality code, mostly written via tutorials.

IDK the specifics yet cause I'm just doing this for fun.
